# ANLP-Take Home Exam

This repository contains the code to train and test two BERT-based models for the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task.

It also contains a small challenge dataset and the code to run behavioral testing on those fine tuned models.
The finetuned models can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1l_rcuAHfyjLdiVn5Ms0r3EyYPGF-6sCT to be downloaded.
Make sure you have installed the packages listed in requirement.txt before running the code.
